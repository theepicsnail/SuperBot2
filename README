This will create a folder called "SuperBot2" wherever you run it.

Note: to use the provided IRCConnector, you must have 'twisted' installed.
For a super quick start, copy and paste everything below into a shell to get the latest
and start running it after some basic configuration

git clone git://github.com/theepicsnail/SuperBot2.git
cd SuperBot2
#You now have the base SB2 install, there's a directory for the SB2IRC submodule
#to fill that in, run the following:
git submodule init
git submodule update
#This will now have cloned SB2IRC into the (What was) empty SuperBot2IRC directory.
#
#Note: Core.cfg is already configured to use SB2IRC, if you were using a different
#      provider, this is where you would put its name.
#
#Now we need to configure the IRC connection
vim SuperBot2IRC/SuperBot2IRC.cfg
#
#
#Now SuperBot2 should be setup, you can run it with
python Core.py


#
# If you want to view the logs, the current way to do this is:
#
python LogViewer.py Logs/* | less
#
# To view any specific log, pass the logs name instaead of * in the line above
#
